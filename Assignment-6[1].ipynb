    "*The Big 12 is a collegiate athletic conference consisting of 10 universities. The conference has experienced some turmoil of late with some teams leaving, a couple new teams joining, and a new commissioner being hired. The new commissioner is trying to cut costs by minimizing travel costs associated with the assignment of officiating crews to next season’s football games. There are five officiating crews that will handle all the games; each crew stays together throughout the entire season. Each week there is a fixed cost associated with the lodging and salaries of the crew, but the travel costs are variable and are determined by the sequence of games officiated by each crew. The Big 12 commissioner wants to keep travel costs as low as possible, but Big 12 rules clearly state that an officiating crew cannot work two consecutive games involving the same team (as the home team or the visitor). The commissioner is considering hiring you to help solve his problem. In order to convince him that you really can solve it, he has provided you with the fictitious six-game schedule in Table 1 (which ignores things like the fact that Texas and Oklahoma play in Dallas each year). The officiating crews are financially responsible for transporting themselves to the first game (as indicated in the table), and for transporting themselves back home from the final game. In order to determine reasonable compensation for travel expenses, the commissioner’s staff recommends using Google Maps to determine the distance between each origin-destination pair. Multiplying these values by `$`0.50 (per mile) $\\times$ 7 officials per crew gives the value (in dollars) that the Big 12 must reimburse the crews.*"
